## Being the Best in the World Is Seriously Underrated

---

#### I FEEL LIKE GIVING UP.

There are moments in everyone's lives when we feel like giving up, while running into different kind of obstacles like Professional or Personal ones.
Most of the time, we deal with obstacles by persevering. Try to inspire ourselves with quotes like "Quitters never win and winners never quit." - by Vince Lombardi. While this words sound catchy, they are not hundred percent true because Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time. Not only winners but most of the other people also quit, they just don't quit successfully.

Extraordinary benefits accrue to the tiny minority of people who are able to push just a tiny bit longer than most.

Extraordinary benefits also accrue to the tiny majority with the guts to quit early and refocus their efforts on something new.

In both cases, it's about being the best in the world. About getting through the hard stuff and coming out on the other side.

- Quit the wrong stuff.
- Stick with the right stuff.
- Have the guts to do one or the other.

#### The Best in the World

Don't quit your quest to be the best in the world because the cost just seems too high.

This is a very short book about a very important topic: quitting. Believe it or not, quitting is often a great strategy, a smart way to manage your life and your career. Sometimes, though, quitting is exactly the wrong thing to do. It turns out that there's a pretty simple way to tell the difference.

In order to get as far as the best in the world you have to quit countless other pursuits. You really can't try to do everything, especially if you intend to be the best in the world.

Before we start on the quitting, though, you probably need to be sold on why being the best in the world matters so much.

#### The Surprising Value of Being the Best in the World

Our culture heavily rewards those who are at the top.
The top-ranked products or individuals receive disproportionately larger benefits.
Winners win big because the marketplace loves a winner.

**Zipf's Law** Describes the skewed distribution where the top item gets exponentially more rewards than lower-ranked items.
Example: The #1 ice cream flavor vastly outsells all other flavors.

The rewards are heavily skewed, so much so that it’s typical for
#1 to get ten times the benefit of #10,
and a hundred times the benefit of #100.

---

#### The Reason Number One Matters

People don't have a lot of time to take a risks. When you are diagnosed with dangerous disease, you're not going to mess around, you will just go to the "top guy", best doctor around.

When you visit new places, you don't want to visit some typical ones, you just ask around for the best.

While you are on a hiring spree for your team, you don't want to hire some average person. You are going to screen out the best qualified people.

With limited time or opportunity to experiment, we intentionally narrow our choices to those at the top. You're not the only person who looks for the best choice. Everyone does. As a result, the rewards for being first are enormous. It's not a linear scale. It's not a matter of getting a little more after giving a little more. It's a curve, and a steep one.

---

#### The (Real) Reason Number One Matters

Being at the top matters because there's room at the top for only a few. Scarcity makes being at the top worth something. There are hundreds of brands of bottled water, and they're all mostly the same. So we don't shop around for bottled water.

Where does the scarcity come from? It comes from the hurdles that the markets and our society set up. It comes from the fact that most competitors quit long before they've created something that makes it to the top. That's the way it's supposed to be. The system depends on it.

---

#### The Best in the World?

Anyone who is going to hire you, buy from you, recommend you, vote for you, or do what you want them to do is going to wonder if you're the best choice.

Best as in: best for them, right now, based on what they believe and what they know. And in the world as in: their world, the world they have access.

So if I'm looking for a freelance copy editor, I want the best copy editor in English, who's available, who can find a way to work with me at a price I can afford. That's my best in the world.

The mass market is dying. There is no longer one best song or one best kind of coffee. Now there are a million micro markets, but each micro market still has a best. If your micro market is "organic markets in Tulsa," then that's your world. And being the best in that world is the place to.

Best is subjective. The consumer get to decide, not you. World is selfish. It's consumer's definition, not yours. It's the world he/she defines, based on his/her convenience or preferences. Be the best in your consumer's world.

The world is getting larger, you can now look everywhere whenever you want to find something or someone. That means that you can define your world to be what really interests you and find your preferences anywhere on the planet

At the same time, the world is getting smaller because everything/everyone is getting more specialized. If you pick the right thing and do it all the way, being best in the world will be much easier.

---

#### The Infinity Problem

The problem with infinity is that there's too much of it.

Nowadays the number of choices in every market is approaching infinity. Faced with infinity, most people panic. Something they don't even buy anything. Sometimes they buy the cheapest one, faced with an infinite number of choices, but most of the cases many people pick the market leader. Better to be the best.

---

#### Is That the Best You Can Do?

Most of the people "settle". They don't go for the best in the world, they settle for less than they are capable of. Don't be like them, always try your best.

If you're not going to put in the effort to be the best possible choice, why do you even bother?

The reason that big companies almost always fail when they try to enter new markets is their willingness to compromise. They figure that because they are big and powerful, they can settle, do less, stop improving something before it is truly remarkable. They compromise to avoid offending other divisions or to minimize their exposure. So they fail. They fail because they don't know when to quit and when to refuse to settle.

#### The Biggest Mistake They Made in School

Traditional emphasis on being well-rounded is misleading.
School often promotes the idea that success comes from being competent in many areas. In reality, success often comes from excelling in a specific area.

Schools often encourage students to develop a broad range of skills to be well-rounded. This approach can dilute efforts and prevent students from achieving mastery in a particular field.

Example: A software engineer who excels in a niche programming language may be more valuable than one who is average in many languages.

- Identify and develop your strengths and areas of passion.
- Aim for excellence and mastery in a specific domain rather than trying to be good at everything.
- Success is more likely to follow when you become the best at something you are passionate about.

In a free market, we reward the exceptional.

the people who are the best in the world specialize at getting really good at the questions they don't know. The people who skip the hard questions are in the majority, but they are not in demand.

#### The Magic of Thinking Quit

Strategic quitting is the secret of successful organizations. Reactive quitting and serial quitting are the bane of those that strive (and fail) to get what they want. And most people do just that. They quit when it's painful and stick when they can't be bothered to quit.

There are two curves that define almost any type of situation facing you as you try to accomplish something. (A couple of minor curves cover the rest.) Understanding the different types of situations that lead you to quit-or that should cause you to quit-is the first step toward getting what you want.

##### CURVE 1: THE DIP

**Almost everything in life worth doing is controlled by the Dip.**

<img src='/The Dip/Assets/curve-dip.png'/>

At the beginning, when you first start something, it's fun. it's interesting, and you get plenty of good feedback from the people around you.
the rapid learning you experience keeps you going. Whatever your new thing is, it's easy to stay engaged in it.

And then the Dip happens.

The Dip is the long slog between starting and mastery. A long slog that's actually a shortcut, because it gets you where you want to go faster than any other path.

The Dip is the difference between the easy "beginner" technique and the more useful "expert" approach.

The Dip is the long stretch between beginner's luck and real accomplishment.

At trade shows, you see dozens of companies trying to break into an industry. They've invested time and money to build a product, to create a marketing organization and rent booth space-all in an attempt to break into a lucrative market. A year later, most of them don't return. They're gone, unable to get through the Dip.

It's easy to be a CEO. What's hard is getting there. There's a huge Dip along the way. If it was easy, there'd be too many people vying for the job and the CEOs couldn't get paid as much, could they? Scarcity, as we've seen, is the secret to value. If there wasn't a Dip, there'd be no scarcity.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Successful people don't just ride out the Dip. They don't just buckle down and survive it. No, they lean into the Dip. They push harder, changing the rules as they go. Just because you know you're in the Dip doesn't mean you have to live happily with it. Dips don't last quite as when you whittle at them.

##### CURVE 2: THE CUL-DE-SAC

<img src='/The Dip/Assets/culdesac.jpeg'/>

The Cul-de-Sac (French for "dead end") is so simple it doesn't even need a chart. It's a situation where you work and you work and you work and nothing much changes. It doesn't get a lot better, it doesn't get a lot worse. It just is. That's why they call those jobs dead-end jobs.

There's not a lot to say about the Cul-de-Sac except to realize that it exists and to embrace the fact that when you find one, you need to get off it, fast. That's because a dead end is keeping you from doing something else. The opportunity cost of investing your life in something that's not going to get better is just too high. That's it. Two big curves (a bonus, the Cliff, follows). Stick with the Dips that are likely to pan out, and quit the Cul-de-Sacs to focus your resources. That's it.

##### CURVE 3: THE CLIFF (RARE BUT SCARY)

Cigarettes, it turns out, were redesigned by scientists to be particularly addictive. If you were going to draw a chart of the pleasure of smoking over time, it would look like this:

<img src='/The Dip/Assets/cliff.png'/>

Except for that nasty drop-off at the end (otherwise known as emphysema), smoking is a marketer's dream come true. Because smoking is designed to be almost impossible to quit, the longer you do it, the better it feels to continue smoking. The pain of quitting just gets bigger and bigger over time. This curve is called a Cliff - it's a situation where you can't quit until you fall off, and the whole thing falls apart. It's no wonder that people have trouble stopping.

---

#### If It Is Worth Doing, There's Probably a Dip

The Dip creates scarcity; scarcity creates value.

<img src='/The Dip/Assets/Graphs.jpg'/>

The Cul-de-Sac is boring, the Cliff is exciting (for a while), but neither gets you through the Dip and both lead to failure.

**The Cul-de-Sac and the Cliff Are the Curves That Lead to Failure.**

If you find yourself facing either of these two curves, you need to quit. Not soon, but right now. The biggest obstacle to success in life, as far as I can tell, is our inability to quit these curves soon enough.

---

#### The Dip Is Where Success Happens

If you haven't already realized it, the Dip is the secret to your success. The people who set out to make it through the Dip-the people who invest the time and the energy and the effort to power through the Dip-those are the ones who become the best in the world.

You will be breaking the system because, instead of moving on to the next thing, instead of doing slightly above average and settling for what you've got, you should embrace the challenge. For whatever reason, you must refuse to abandon the quest and you will push through the Dip all the way to the next level.

Learning the basic skills constitutes a painful Dip. It's easier to quit than it is to keep going. The brave thing to do is to tough it out and end up on the other side-getting all the benefits that come from scarcity.

The mature thing is not even to bother starting to learn because you're probably not going to make it through the Dip. And the stupid thing to do is to start, give it your best shot, waste a lot of time and money, and quit right in the middle of the Dip.

A few people will choose to do the brave thing and end up the best in the world. Informed people will probably choose to do the mature thing and save their resources for something they're truly passionate about.

Both are fine choices. It's the last choice, the common choice, the choice to give it a shot and then quit that you must avoid if you want to succeed.

---

#### What Butch Knew

Your marketplace is competitive, filled with people overcoming challenges every day. It's the incredibly difficult challenges (the Dips) that give you the opportunity to pull ahead.

In a competitive world, adversity is your ally. The harder it gets, the better chance you have of insulating yourself from the competition. If that adversity also causes you to quit, though, it's all for nothing.

---

#### What Jack Knew

When Jack Welch remade GE (General Electric), the most fabled decision he made was this: If we can’t be #1 or #2 in an industry, we must get out.

Jack Welch's approach at GE emphasized exiting less dominant businesses to concentrate on divisions where GE could be #1 or #2, fostering a culture of excellence and strategic focus.

---

#### The Thing About the Wind

Just like wind makes windsurfing difficult, unpredictability complicates various organizational functions.

**Examples of "Wind" in Business:**

- **Customer Service:**
  - Customers' unpredictable behavior makes it challenging.
- **Accounting:**
  - Accuracy and timeliness of reports are often unpredictable.
- **Sales:**
  - Not all prospects buy, creating unpredictability.
- **Marketing:**
  - Prospects and customers may not think the same way as the marketers.

Embrace the Challenge:

- The difficulty and unpredictability create opportunities for profit and differentiation.
- These challenges ensure that specialists are needed and valued.

Perspective Shift:

- Difficult interactions (e.g., with customers or agencies) make your role significant.
- Without challenges, jobs would be easy and replaceable.

**_The Dip is your very best friend_**

- Overcoming these "wind" challenges is crucial.
- Success comes from solving hard problems, making you irreplaceable.

Challenges and unpredictability in business functions are analogous to the wind in windsurfing. They make tasks difficult but also create opportunities for specialization and profit. Embrace these challenges as they validate your importance and unreplaceable in the organization.

---

#### The Reason We're Here

**_The Dip is the reason you're here_**
You get what you deserve when you embrace the Dip and treat it like the opportunity that it really is.

---

#### The Lie of Diversification - What Woodpeckers Know

When faced with the Dip, many individuals and organizations diversify.

the real success goes to those who obsess. The focus that leads you through the Dip to the other side is rewarded by a marketplace in search of the best in the world.

**Example:** A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy. Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner.

Before you enter a new market, consider what would happen if you managed to get through the Dip and win in the market you're already in.

---

#### Most People Are Afraid to Quit

It's easier to be mediocre than it is to confront reality and quit.

**Quitting is difficult.** Quitting requires you to acknowledge that you're never going to be #1 in the world. At least not at this. So it's easier just to put it off, not admit it, settle for mediocre. What a waste.

---

#### You Should Be Angry Now...

I know that I am... I'm angry at all the worthwhile organizations that persist in dead-end ventures (Cul-de-Sacs) instead of abandoning them and reallocating their resources to more promising areas. I'm angry at all the people who have wasted time and money trying to overcome a Dip that they should have recognized was too vast and too deep to get through with the resources they had available. Mostly, I'm angry that it took me this long to articulate how simple the solution is.

---

#### How Arnold beat the Dip

The essential thing to know about the Dip is that it's there. Knowing that you're facing a Dip is the first step in getting through it.

It's human nature to quit when it hurts. But it's that reflex that creates scarcity.

**The challenge is simple**: Quitting when you hit the Dip is a bad idea. If the journey you started was worth doing, then quitting when you hit the Dip just wastes the time you've already invested. Quit in the Dip often enough and you'll find yourself becoming a serial quitter, starting many things but accomplishing little.

**Simple**: If you can't make it through the Dip, don't start. If you can embrace that simple rule, you'll be a lot choosier about which journeys you start.

---

#### Superstar Thinking

Superstars get what they want because they have unique skills. A superstar is the best in the world at what she does.

If you want to be a superstar, then you need to find a field with a steep Dip —a barrier between those who try and those who succeed. And you've got to get through that Dip to the other side. This isn't for everyone. If it were, there'd be no superstars. If you choose this path, it's because you realize that there's a Dip, and you believe you can get through it. The Dip is actually your greatest ally because it makes the project worthwhile (and keeps others from competing with you.)

But wait, that's not enough. Not only do you need to find a Dip that you can conquer but you also need to quit all the Cul-de-Sacs that you're currently idling your way through. You must quit the projects and investments and endeavors that don't offer you the same opportunity. It's difficult, but it's vitally important.

### Seven Reasons You Might Fail to Become the Best in the World

- You run out of time (and quit).
- You run out of money (and quit).
- You get scared (and quit).
- You're not serious about it (and quit).
- You lose interest or enthusiasm or settle for being mediocre (and quit).
- You focus on the short term instead of the long (and quit when the short term gets too hard).
- You pick the wrong thing at which to be the best in the world (because you don't have the talent).

"you" means your team, your company, or just plain you, the job seeker, the employee, or the entrepreneur.

The important thing to remember about these seven things is that you can plan for them. You can know before you start whether or not you have the resources and the will to get to the end. Most of the time, if you fail to become the best in the world, it's either because you planned wrong or because you gave up before you reached your goal.

---

#### Why Is the Curve with a Dip so Prevalent?

Whatever you do for a living, or for fun, it's probably somehow based on a system that’s based on quitting. Quitting creates scarcity; scarcity creates value.

It's no wonder we quit. The system wants us to.

---

### Eight Dip Curves

Here are a bunch of systems that are dependent on Dips. These Dips are in the places where organizations and individuals are most likely to give up. If you see these Dips coming, you're more likely to make a choice. You can choose (in advance) to do whatever you need to do in order to get through the Dip, knowing it's going to be difficult; or you can give up before you get there. Quitting in the Dip, though, isn't worth the journey.

#### MANUFACTURING DIP:

- **Initial Stage:** Easy and fun to start small-scale manufacturing (e.g., building in a garage).
- **Dip Stage:** Difficult and expensive to scale up (e.g., buying injection molds, designing integrated circuits, large-scale production).
- **Impact of the Dip:** High time, effort, and cost create a barrier.
- **Result:** Limits supply and rewards those who invest in scaling up.
- **Example:** Local craft fair artists struggle because they haven't scaled up their production.

#### SALES DIP

- **Initial Selling Stage:** Starts with one person selling the idea to stores, businesses, consumers, or voters.

- **Dip Stage:** Occurs when upgrading to a professional sales force and scaling up is necessary.

- **Challenges:**

  - Transitioning from individual selling to a structured sales force.
  - Requires significant investment in training, infrastructure, and personnel.
  - Overcoming the first, bigger competitor with a big, aggressive sales force who has a huge advantage

- **Competitive Advantage:** The first competitor with a robust, aggressive sales force gains a significant edge.

#### EDUCATION DIP

- **Initial Career Start:**

  - Career begins upon leaving school with existing knowledge and skills.

- **Dip Stage:**

  - Occurs when it's time to learn something new or reinvent/rebuild skills.

- **Challenges:**

  - Transitioning from foundational education to specialized or advanced learning.
  - Requires sacrifices such as time, effort, and potentially financial investment.

- **Long-Term Rewards:**

  - Sacrifices made for specialized education yield rewards over decades.
  - Example: A doctor investing a year in a specialty reaps rewards throughout their career.

- **Importance:**
  - Critical stage for professional growth and staying competitive in evolving industries.

#### RISK DIP

- **Bootstrapping Challenges:**

  - Bootstrappers realize they can't fund everything themselves, particularly from current income.

- **Dip Stage:**

  - Hits when it becomes necessary to take risks such as renting a larger space or investing in new techniques.

- **Understanding Risk:**

  - Successful entrepreneurs differentiate between:
    - Investing to navigate through the Dip (a strategic move).
    - Investing in risky ventures with uncertain outcomes.

- **Strategic Investing:**
  - Smart investments facilitate progress through the Dip and enhance long-term prospects.
- **Importance:**
  - Knowing when and where to take calculated risks is crucial for sustained growth and success in entrepreneurship.

#### RELATIONSHIP DIP

- **Building Relationships:**

  - Investing time and effort in building relationships with people and organizations is essential.

- **Dip Stage:**

  - Occurs when it's challenging to invest in relationships, especially when it's not urgent.

- **Long-Term Benefits:**

  - Relationships cultivated during difficult times pay off later.
  - Example: Someone who started in the mailroom and built relationships became the CEO.

- **Shortsighted Approach:**

  - People who only seek favors or breaks without investing in relationships struggle to progress.
  - They fail to navigate through the relationship Dip because they didn't invest in relationships during challenging times.

- **Importance:**
  - Investing in relationships during challenging times lays the foundation for future success and opportunities.

#### CONCEPTUAL DIP

- **Operating Assumptions:**

  - Progress is made based on existing assumptions and paradigms.

- **Dip Stage:**

  - Occurs when it becomes necessary to abandon old assumptions and adopt a new, broader set.

- **Reinvention:**

  - Heroes who reinvent institutions and industries, like Martin Luther King Jr. and Richard Branson, navigate through the conceptual Dip.

- **Challenges:**

  - Embracing new paradigms requires courage, effort, and a willingness to challenge the status quo.

- **Long-Term Impact:**

  - Working through the conceptual Dip leads to significant breakthroughs and advancements.

- **Importance:**
  - Embracing new concepts and paradigms is essential for personal and organizational growth, innovation, and staying relevant in evolving environments.

#### EGO DIP

- **Individual Focus:**

  - Initial success often revolves around individual efforts and ego.

- **Dip Stage:**

  - Occurs when it becomes necessary to relinquish control and prioritize the organization's goals over personal interests.

- **Challenges:**

  - Giving up control and the spotlight is difficult for many individuals.
  - Getting stuck in this Dip is common due to the reluctance to let go of ego-driven behaviors.

- **Leverage Through Organization:**

  - Leaning into the organization and empowering others provides leverage and fosters collective success.

- **Importance:**
  - Overcoming the Ego Dip is crucial for effective leadership, team collaboration, and organizational growth.

#### DISTRIBUTION DIP

- **Retailer Accessibility:**

  - Some retailers (e.g., local strip malls, online platforms) offer easy distribution for products.
  - Others (e.g., Target, Wal-Mart) require significant investment but may yield substantial returns.

- **Dip Stage:**

  - Occurs when transitioning from accessible distribution channels to those requiring substantial investment.

- **Challenges:**

  - Investment required for distribution in larger retailers like Wal-Mart is significant.
  - Limited availability and high demand create scarcity, enhancing the appeal of such retailers.

- **Scarcity Factor:**

  - Distribution in stores like Wal-Mart offers potential for massive sales due to scarcity and higher visibility.
  - Online platforms have more competition and lower barriers to entry.

- **Importance:**
  - Understanding distribution dynamics helps in making strategic decisions about where to allocate resources for maximum impact and sales potential.

#### Seeing the Curve in Advance
it's pretty easy to determine whether something is a Cul-de-Sac or a Dip. The hard part is finding the guts to do something about it.
The pain (and the waste) comes when the optimists have to make hard choices when they get stuck in the Dip.

---

#### Time to Cancel the Space Shuttle
There's no reason to keep investing in something that is not going to get better.

Do you have the guts to quit when facing a Cul-de-Sac?

So why don't we cancel it? Why not quit? Same reason as always. Because day to day, it's easier to stick with something that we're used to, that doesn't make too many waves, that doesn't hurt.

---

#### The Valley of Death
That's the goal of any competitor: to create a Dip so long and so deep that the nascent competition can't catch up.

Microsoft does it. They've built so many relationships and established so many standards that it's essentially inconceivable that someone will challenge Word or Excel-at least until the platform changes.

Make it through the competition's barriers and you get to be king for a while.

See the book's examples on dominating the market. 

---

#### The Big Opportunity
If you can get through the Dip, if you can keep going when the system is expecting you to stop, you will achieve extraordinary results. very few people persist through a challenging period (the Dip) to achieve success on the other side, so they generate more value.

When you're the best in the world, you share the benefits (the income, the attention, the privileges, the respect) with just a handful of people or organizations or brands.

You know this already. You're not stupid, and you've noticed all your life that the big benefits accrue to those who don't quit. And it hasn't made a difference so far, so why should you listen to this now?

Because you grew up believing that quitting is a moral failing. Quitting feels like a go-down moment, a moment, where you look yourself in the eye and blink. Of course you are trying your best. But you just can’t do it.

You should rather have focus on quitting (or not quitting) as a go-up opportunity. Quitting stuff you don't care about or the stuff you're mediocre or better yet quitting the Cul-de-Sacs frees up your resources to obsess about the Dips that matter, You should remember that it's not about avoiding the humilation of failure.

---

#### Average Is for Losers
Quitting at the right time is difficult. Most of us don't have the guts to quit. Worse, when faced with the Dip, sometimes we don't quit. Instead, we get mediocre.

The most common response to the Dip is to play it safe. To do ordinary work, blameless work, work that's beyond reproach. When faced the Dip, most people try to average their way to sucess.

To be the best in the world, you must do something exceptional. Not just survive the Dip, but use the Dip as an opportunity to create something so extraordinary that people can't help but talk about it, recommend it and, of course, choose it.

<img src='/The Dip/Assets/fail.jpg'/>

The next time you catch yourself being average when you feeel like quitting, realize that you have only two good choices: Quit ir be Exceptional. Average is for losers.

Average feels safe but it's not. it's the last choice - path of least resistance. The temptation to be average is just another kind of quitting, which should be avoided.

You deserve better than average.

---

#### Serial Quitters Spend a Lot of Time in Line
While starting up something new is thrilling, your effort will only pays off after you get through the Dip.
Countless entrepreneurs have perfected the starting part, but give up long before finishing paying their dues.    
The bad news is that when you start over, you get very little credit for how long you stood in line with your last great venture.

if it takes ten impressions to make an impact, and you've delieved the eight, that switch is going to cost you a lot of time, money and energy.

---

#### Salespeople Who Quit
Selling is about a transference of emotion, not a presentation of facts. if it were just a presentation of facts, then a PDF flyer or a Website would be sufficient(enough) to make the phone ring.

Please understand this: If you'are not able to get through the Dip in an exceptional way, you must quit and change your focus to something else.

---

#### Facing the Dip
Hence the Dip of market acceptance. The marketers who get rewarded are the ones who don't quit. They hunker down through the Dip and galvanize, protect, insulate and perfect their product while others keep looking for yet another quick hit.

Job seekers face the Dip because human resources departments support it. HR doesn't show up at your door and offer you a job. They set hurdles (like submitting a résumé or wearing a suit or flying to Cleveland) as a way of screening out the folks who aren't actually serious about a job.

It's easy to be seduced by the new money and the rush to the fresh. The problem is that this leads to both an addiction and a very short attention span. If it doesn't work today, the thinking goes, why should I wait around until tomorrow? The problem is that only a tiny portion of the audience is looking for the brand-new thing. Most people are waiting for the tested, the authenticated, and the proven.

Very quietly, the Microsofts of the world hang in, going from version 1 to version 2, knowing that by version 3, the world will be a different (and better) place for them. Microsoft failed twice with Windows, four times with Word, three times with Excel. The entire company is based on the idea of slogging through the Dip, relentlessly changing tactics but never quitting the big idea.

<img src='/The Dip/Assets/yet.jpg'/>

#### What Business Are You In?
You should (must) have to quit the product or feature or design, and yes you need to do it regurarly, if you're going to grow and have the resources to invest in the right businesses. But no, you mustn't quit a market or a strategy or a niche.

Don't fall in love with a tactic and defend it forever. Instead, decide once and for all whether you're in a market or not. And if you are, get through that Dip.

Persistence is key in the market's eyes. Don't be discouraged by setbacks – overcoming challenges demonstrates your commitment.  The market seeks signals of credibility, strength, and reliability.  Remember, most people prefer established and trusted options.

---

#### The Opposite of Quitting Isn't "Waiting Around"

the opposite of quitting is rededication. The opposite of quitting is an invigorated new strategy designed to break the problem apart

---

#### It's a mistake to view the Dip as static
When the pain gets so bad that you're ready to quit, you've set yourself up as someone with nothing to lose. And someone with nothing to lose has quite a bit of power. You can go for broke. Challenge authority. Attempt unattempted alternatives. Lean into a problem; lean so far that you might just lean right through it.

---

#### Giving up in the Dip Is Usually a Short-term Decision-and a Bad One
A common mistake with lasting consequences. When people quit, they are often focused on the short-term benefits. People often prioritize immediate relief from difficulty, stopping when things get challenging, In other words, "If it hurts, they just stop to get rid of pain"

#### No One Quits the Boston Marathon at Mile 25

Persistent people are able to visualize the idea of light at the end of the tunnel when others can't see it. At the same time, the smartest people are realistic about not imagining light when there isn't any.

Winners understand that taking that pain now prevents a lot more pain later.

The decision to quit or not is a simple evaluation: Is the pain of the Dip worth the benefit of the light at the end of the tunnel.

## If You're Not Going to Get to #1, You Might as Well Quit Now

### QUIT!

> It’s okay to quit, sometimes.

**In fact, it's okay to quit often.**   
You should quit if you're on a dead-end path. You should quit if you're facing a Cliff. You should quit if the project you're working on has a Dip that isn't worth the reward at the end. Quitting the projects that don't go anywhere is essential if you want to stick out the right ones. You don't have the time or the passion or the resources to be the best in the world at both.

#### Quitting a Tactic vs. Quitting a Strategy

Getting off a Cul-de-Sac is not a moral failing. It's just smart. Seeing a Cliff coming far in advance isn't a sign of weakness. Instead, it represents real insight and bravery. It frees up your energy for the Dip.

#### Quitting as an Intelligent Strategy
The time to look for a new job is when you don't need one. The time to switch jobs is before it feels comfortable. Go. Switch. Challenge yourself; get yourself a raise and a promotion. You owe it to your career and your skills.

If your job is a Cul-de-Sac, you have to quit or accept the fact that your career is over.

#### Quitting Is Not the Same as Failing

Strategic quitting is a conscious decision you make based on the choices that are available to you. If you realize you're at a dead end (Cul-de-Sac) compared with what you could be investing in, quitting is not only a reasonable choice, it's a smart one.

Failing, on the other hand, means that your dream is over. Failing happens when you give up, when there are no other options, or when you quit so often that you've used up all your time and resources.

It's easy to wring your hands about becoming a failure. Quitting smart, though, is a great way to avoid failing. Instead of worrying about failure, let's brainstorm strategies for success. It's natural to worry about setbacks, but they're opportunities to learn and grow.
