# BE A MIRROR

## ASSUMPTIONS BLIND, HYPOTHESES GUIDE

Good negotiators know they have to be ready for possible surprises but great negotiators aim to use their skills and experience to reveal the surprises.

Experienced negotiators benefit from holding multiple hypotheses about the situation, their counterpart's desires, and various other factors simultaneously. Staying present and alert, they continuously use new information to discern true hypotheses from false ones, refining their understanding as the negotiation progresses.

In negotiation, every new psychological insight or piece of information is a step forward, enabling you to replace one hypothesis with another. Approach negotiations with a discovery mindset, aiming to gather and observe as much information as possible. Interestingly, highly intelligent individuals may struggle with this, as they often believe they have nothing left to discover.

People often stick to their beliefs and assumptions, even before meeting others, which distorts their perception of situations. This leads to a flawed and static understanding. Great negotiators, however, question these assumptions, staying emotionally open to possibilities and intellectually agile in dynamic situations.

Until you fully understand a situation, you can't accurately address it. Assumptions often prove incorrect, so avoid making unnecessary ones.
