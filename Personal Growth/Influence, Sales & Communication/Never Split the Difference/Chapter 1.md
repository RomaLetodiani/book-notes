# NEW RULES

To buy time during negotiations, use the tactic of 'calibrated questions' â€” queries with no fixed answers that the other side can respond to. These questions give your counterpart the illusion of control, making them believe they have the answers and power. Meanwhile, you gain time to devise a strategy to win the negotiation.

## THE SMARTEST DUMB GUY IN THE ROOM

Answering your calibrated questions should demand deep emotional strength and tactical psychological insight.

Here are some examples of calibrated questions:

1. What challenges are you facing in this situation?
2. How can we address your concerns?
3. What is most important to you in this agreement?
4. How would you like to see this resolved?
5. What are your priorities right now?
6. What factors led you to this decision?
7. How can we move forward from here?
8. What would you need from us to feel comfortable with this deal?
9. How do you see this benefiting both of us?
10. What would it take to make this work for you?

Before negotiating, understand human psychology: we are all crazy, unstable, irrational, impulsive, and emotionally driven animals. Raw intelligence and mathematical logic only help us hide our true selves and put on masks.

Avoid following a scripted, predetermined sequence of actions, offers, and counteroffers designed to achieve a specific outcome. For example, you might think that trying A, B, C, D will give you X, but real-world negotiations are far more unpredictable and complex. Unlike dealing with a robot, where a specific code or algorithm yields a certain answer, negotiation requires flexibility. You might need to do A, then D, and perhaps Q, because the outcome is often uncertain.

## HEART VS. MIND

The emotional brain-that animalistic, unreliable, and irrational beast-could be overcome through a more rational, joint problem-solving mindset. Instead of trying to understand what other side is asking for, focus on why they are asking for it. Work cooperatively to generate win-win options. Try to come up with standards, which both sides agree on, for evaluating possible solutions.

- **Framing Effect** demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice, depending on how it is framed, for example, they place greater value on moving from 90% to 100% - than 45% to 55%, even though both chances increase by ten percent.

- **Prospect Theory** explains that behavior, why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses.

- **Loss Aversion** shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain.

Most of the humans have two systems of thought:

- System 1, our animal mind, which is fast instinctive and emotional.
- System 2, more logical, deliberative, slow, it guides and steers our rational thoughts.

System 1's inchoate believes, feelings and impressions are the main sources of the explicit believes and delibrate choices of System 2.
They're the spring that feeds the river. We react emotionally with System 1 to a suggestion or question. Then that System 1 reaction informs and effect creates the System 2 answer.
Knowing how to affect your counterpart's System 1 thinking, by framing and delivering your questions and statements thoughtfully, you can guide his/her System 2's rationality and therefore modify the responses from him/her.

Conducting negotiations based on only System 2 concepts without the ability and tools to read, understand and manipulate the System 1, emotional underpinning, is like trying to make an omelet without first knowing how to crack an egg.

## THE FBI GETS EMOTIONAL

People want to be understood and accepted and Listening is the cheapest and most effective concession we can use to get there. By listening intensely, you demonstrate empathy and show a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing or is waiting to get out of the deal.

When individuals feel listened to, they become more self-aware and open to evaluating their own thoughts and feelings. This reduces defensiveness and increases their willingness to consider other viewpoints. As a result, they reach a calm and logical state, enhancing their problem-solving and negotiation skills, aligning with the principles of effective conflict resolution found in "Getting to Yes."

Tactical Empathy, a form of listening akin to a martial art, combines emotional intelligence and assertive influence to connect deeply with another person's mind. Contrary to popular belief, listening is an active, dynamic process and one of the most powerful tools for understanding and influencing others.

## LIFE IS NEGOTIATION

Allow me to let you in on a secret: **_Life is Negotiation_**.  
The majority of interactions we have at work, home, or elsewhere, are  
negotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalistic urge: **_I want_**.

Negotiation is crucial for two primary functions: gathering information and influencing behavior. It encompasses nearly all interactions where each party has desires. Success in your career, finances, reputation, love life, and even your children's future depends on your negotiation skills.

Negotiation is essentially communication that achieves results. Getting what you want out of life is all about getting what you want from or with other people. Conflict between two parties is inevitable in all relationships. So it's useful, even crucial, to know how to engage in that conflict to get what you want without inflicting damage. You'll learn to use your emotions, instincts, and insights in any encounter to connect better with others, influence them, and achieve more.

To master daily negotiation, first overcome any aversion to it. You don't need to like it. You just need to Understand that negotiation is a fundamental part of how the world works. It's not about being aggressive or grinding someone down, but about engaging in the emotional dynamics of human interaction. In life, you get what you ask for, you just have to ask correctly. So claim your prerogative to ask for what you believe is fair.

This book will teach you to reclaim control of the conversations that inform your life and career. It offers a practical and thoughtful perspective on leading psychological theories. It distills lessons from a 24-year career in the FBI and a decade of teaching and consulting at top business schools and corporations. Its effectiveness comes from real-world origins and extensive experience, It was not born in a classroom or a training hall, but built from years of experience that improved it until it reached near perfection.

## THE BOOK

Like a contractor building a house, this book is constructed from the ground up: first comes the big slabs of foundation, then the necessary load-bearing walls, the elegant but impermeable roof, and the lovely interior decorations.

This topic describes what you'll learn from each Chapter.
