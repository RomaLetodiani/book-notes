## How To Look At The World ( Like an Artist )

First, you figure out what’s worth stealing, then you move
on to the next thing.

That’s about all there is to it.

When you look at the world this way, you stop worrying about what’s “good” and what’s “bad”—there’s only stuff worth stealing, and stuff that’s not worth stealing.

## Nothing Is Original

> “Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But, since no one was listening, everything must be said again.” - André Gide

> “What is originality? Undetected plagiarism.” - William Ralph Inge

## The Genealogy of Ideas

Every new idea is just a mashup or a remix of one or more previous ideas.

You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences.

> “We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.” - Goethe

You don’t get to pick your family, but you can pick your teachers and you can pick your friends and you can pick the music you listen to and you can pick the books you read and you can pick the movies you see.

## Garbage In, Garbage Out

Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by.

> “Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.” - Jim Jarmusch

## Climb Your Own Family Tree

> “I don’t believe in art. I believe in artists.” - Marcel Duchamp

Study the artists who you find inspirational.

Find out at least 3 people who they admired so that you can build your own tree of ideas.

Seeing yourself as part of a creative lineage will help you feel less alone as you start making your own stuff.

You can learn whatever you want from them. They left their lesson plans in their work
